		<h3>Biography</h3><hr>
		
		<p>Josephine Chan was born in New York City, New York on March 21.<br>
		Her parents were immigrants who immigrated from Fujian, China with little to none english.<br>
		At youth she was able to speak in four different languages: English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Fijianese.<br>
		However, she lost the ability to speak Fujianese after her visit in China from using Mandarin too much in pre-school.<br>
		Although she's unable to speak the language she's able to understand it fluently. As if that language has been sealed inside her. <br><br>
		
		Josephine grew to be a very active girl due to her aunt (her dad's younger sister).<br>
		Whenenver her aunt sees her, she would always take her on a wondorous journey: camping, hiking, rock climbing and many others.<br>
		Josephine is a shy girl but due to her encounters with her aunt, it made her become an extroverted introvert.<br>
		She became more confident and courageous.<br>
		She would constantly visit her aunt in San Francisco, california in the Summer.<br>
		At the age of 7, she was able to ride the plane alone to visit her dear aunt.<br><br>
		
		Sadly 好景不长, good times don't last.<br>
		In the Fall of third grade, her aunt died due to an accident from rock climbing.<br>
		It was unfortunate but Josephine couldn't feel the sadness in her.<br>
		She doesn't hold any regrets for her aunt because she spent her most wonderful of her youth with her.<br>
		She was content.<br>
		She lives her life in content and walks forward with curiosity. She lives her life the way she wants happily.<br><br>
